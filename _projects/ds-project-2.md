## Overview

Remote data science work conducted with the **Vogelsberger Lab at MIT**. The project involved applying machine learning forecasting baselines to a large WHO breast cancer dataset and building frameworks that make analytical findings actionable for stakeholders.

## Published Work

*Prediction of Patient Breast Cancer Probability* — Applied and Computational Engineering, 47(1):207–212, March 2024.

## What I Built

**Forecasting models** — Applied scikit-learn across 5 datasets comparing SVR, polynomial regression, and shallow neural networks. All results cross-validated for robustness.

**Visualization suite** — Built insight-driven visuals for a 100,000-population WHO dataset using Matplotlib and Seaborn, surfacing trend shifts and outliers for clinical stakeholders.

**A/B testing framework** — Used SciPy to identify factors associated with user drop-offs in data visualization tools, resulting in a 12% increase in user engagement.

**Data lake architecture** — Designed a lightweight data lake (raw/curated/feature zones) using partitioned Parquet files with schema/version control and data quality checks. Explored NoSQL for scalable ingestion.

**Model serving** — Packaged models as internal Flask/FastAPI services to enable rapid deployment and reproducible experiment results.
