## Hi, I'm Wenyang 👋

I'm a **Machine Learning Engineer and QA Automation Developer** based in Montreal, QC. I hold a Bachelor of Arts in **Joint Major Data Science** from Concordia University (2025), and I'm a published researcher in medical image segmentation.

I sit at the intersection of **machine learning** and **software quality** — I build models that work, and test systems that prove it. Whether I'm training a lightweight U-Net on medical imaging data or engineering a cross-platform Appium automation suite, I care about one thing: systems that are reliable, observable, and reproducible.

### Research

My most recent work at the **Salehanil Lab @ Concordia** involved integrating Squeeze-and-Excitation attention blocks into a lightweight U-Net for breast cancer detection, achieving **88.88% Dice / 81.26% mIoU** and outperforming Attention U-Net and SSL baselines. The model runs at near real-time inference with just 3.10M parameters and 0.72 GFLOPs.

I also worked remotely with the **Vogelsberger Lab @ MIT**, applying ML forecasting models to WHO breast cancer datasets and building A/B testing frameworks that increased user engagement by 12%.

### Engineering

Six+ years of professional experience building automation systems across Unity Technologies, Autodesk, TrackTik, MavTek, and Nuance. I've written test frameworks in Python, Java, C#, and JavaScript; built predictive risk models that reduced critical bugs by 42%; and shipped CI/CD-integrated QA pipelines that teams rely on.
